This goal of this project is to train a machine to learn, using a Convolutional Neural Network, how to determine what art
period (e.g. Baroque, Neoclassicalâ€¦etc.) a given sculpture belongs to using just the image. For example, given an image
of the sculpture David by Bernini we would want our model to output the art period as Baroque. This project is being done
in fulfillment of my Senior Thesis.
