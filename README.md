# Sculpture Style Classification

This goal of this project is to train a machine to learn, using a Convolutional Neural Network, how to determine what
art style (e.g. Baroque, Neoclassicalâ€¦etc.) a given sculpture belongs to using just the image. For example, given an
image of the sculpture *David* by Bernini we would want our model to output the art period as Baroque. This project is
being done in fulfillment of my Senior Thesis.

For those interested, I made an accompanying [app](http://sculpture-app.harryshomer.com/) for this project as well. It
also includes a brief discussion of the methodology.
